                               <h4><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>
                               <div id="ab">
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Airports are the places where landings and takeoffs of the flights take place. In general, airports are preferred for travelling over large distances. While travelling in flights we carry our baggage which consists of various items, but the items that are prohibited in the baggage are scissors, knives, gun, and the electronic devices which cannot be switched off. Carrying dangerous items may lead to the Hijack of flights and it even led to unusual situations in the airport. To prevent public from threat, airports generally have security inspection in which you will be required to pass your luggage through an X-ray machine where it will be checked for dangerous items. This project deals with software side of the security inspection. We gather the X-ray images related to the airport baggage. We use Deep Learning (DL) and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms to detect the threat items. The development of this work will go without the ground truth labels. The algorithms enlarge the images and analyzes the area of threat items.</p>

                               <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
                               <div id="ab">
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The process of relocating someone or something is known as transportation. People prefer transportation over large distances. There are so many transportation systems all over the world. Some of them are rail transport, bus transport, and airport transport etc., The fastest transportation is the air travel transportation system.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">People travelling with luggage should handover the luggage that would need to go into the cargo holdings. There are certain restrictions that luggage should be within the required size and weight. After the destination is reached people need to pick up any bags that are checked.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Baggageâ€™s are often checked at airline systems to recognize the threat items such as knife, gun, blade, and explosive devices etc., the luggage is transferred through the panel to check x-ray screening. The panel recognizes the threat items through imaging. The service agents will weigh the baggage and print the details of the passenger on a tag which will be attached to the checked luggage</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">To improve the detection rate of threat items, a new methodology has been proposed with two preprocessing techniques of Computer Vision (CV) and several object detection algorithms of Deep Learning (DL) are to be tested to prove the theory. The CV algorithms are Super-Resolution (SR) and Image-Enhancement (IE). The input is fed by the dataset i.e., GDXray. The outputs of this stages represent high quality and sharpened images. This is further fed to the DL object detection model. At last, the performance of the threat item detection will be measured according to module wise outputs of module 1 (Super-Resolution) and 2 (Image-Enhancement).</p>
